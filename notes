Ok, so what do I even want this thing to do?
- allow the user to select which dietary restriction they want to adhere to
- provide a pop up that displays 'avoid' foods.
- allow the user to compile a list of ingredients to go shopping for.
- text the user their final list.
- save lists and recipes for later dates.
	- including url to original recipe.


Ok, so what will I need?
- a chrome options page so they can adjust which diet.
- a twilio account that will text the user their ingredients
- a database to host individual users recipes and links

Alright, now what steps to I need to accomplish?
- set up individual user accounts

- set up database
- get twilio texting working
- add additional diets to database
- see if you can send an ajax request to the database from the popup.


Database layout:
collection: users {
	user1 : {
		recipe1 : [ingredients list],
		recipe2 : [ingredients list]
	}
	user2 : {
		recipe1: [ingredients list]
	}
}
